        <p>Alex has been missing since April 4th, 2025. Her family is urgently searching for any information that could
          help locate her. Even the smallest detail could make a difference. <br> <br> Alex is a Journalism major at the
          University of Central Florida and an active member of multiple campus organizations. <strong>Current known
            details are
            that she was last seen on campus around 6pm and last online the day she went missing. She spoke to her
            roommate that evening before leaving.</strong> <br><br>

          Below are links to Alex's primarily-used social media as well as that of her friends who are coordinating to
          find her. We are looking for any information that would be helpful in finding them. <br><br><u> Emergency
            Services have already been contacted and are already doing everything they can.</u>

        <p>Alex, as stated, was a journalism major and loved writing articles and blog posts. She posted them on her
          personal website and anyone visiting it would be able to get a good idea of who Alex is and what she was so
          passionate about. We noticed her more recent blog posts were a bit strange and alarming, but so far has not
          been linked to anything we know of.</p>
